##Leetcode solutions, code skeletons, and unit tests (in progress)

### A not bad starting point for your [Leetcode journey](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/). 

#####For Java
* Discussions and code review are more than welcome.
* OJ-accepted solutions are provided in `src/*/Solution.java` for your reference.
* `src/*/Practice.java` provides code skeleton for each problem.
* `test/*/PracticeTest.java` provides basic unit tests to verify your solution.
* Special data structure used in Leetcode problems, like `Linked List`, is stored in `com.leetcode.*.java`

P.S.:

- Many solutions are from online sources, like Leetcode OJ discussion, coders' blogs, etc.
- Solution that passed unit tests does not guarantee to pass Leetcode OJ.
