##Leetcode solutions, code skeletons, and unit tests (in progress)

### A not bad starting point for your [Leetcode journey](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/). 

#####For Java
* Discussions and code reviews are more than welcome.
* `Solution.java` provides OJ-accepted solution.
* `Practice.java` provides code skeleton for each problem
* `SolutionTest.java` and `PracticeTest.java` provides basic unit tests to verify your solution.

P.S.:

- Many solutions are from online sources, like Leetcode OJ discussion, coders' blogs, etc.
- Solution that passed unit tests does not guarantee to pass Leetcode OJ.
