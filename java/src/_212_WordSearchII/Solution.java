 * Description: 
 * 
 * Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all 
 * words in the board. 
 * 
 * Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, 
 * where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. 
 * The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word. 
 * 
 * For example, 
 * 
 * Given words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board = 
 * [ 
 *  ['o','a','a','n'], 
 *  ['e','t','a','e'], 
 *  ['i','h','k','r'], 
 *  ['i','f','l','v'] 
 * ] 
 * 
 * Return ["eat","oath"]. 
 * 
 * Note: You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
