##Leetcode solutions in Java (in progress)
###Solutions, unit tests, and code skeletons for problems from [Leetcode OJ](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/). 

* Discussions and code review are more than welcome.
* OJ-accepted solutions are provided in `Solution*.java` for your reference.
* `Practice.java` provides code skeleton for each problem
* `SolutionTest.java` and `PracticeTest.java` provides basic unit tests to verify your solution.

P.S.:

- Many solutions are from online sources, like Leetcode OJ discussion, coders' blogs, etc.
- Solution that passed unit tests does not guarantee to pass Leetcode OJ.
